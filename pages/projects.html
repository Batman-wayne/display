                    <p>Project Sentinel taught me a lot. The project was ambitious because of how difficult the algorithms involved were. I have only had conceptual exposure to SLAM and Kalman filters, and these were crucial to Sentinel's operation. The idea was still extremely interesting, so I have still decided to pursue it. However, this time, I will trying to figure out the algorithm first. The current plan is to use a physics plugin and model Sentinel. The plugin allows me to define the robot using kinematic models and control it using code. This will allow for a robust testbench where the SLAM algorithm and Kalman filter can hopefully be figured out and tuned. From here, it shouldn't be too hard to port this over to actual hardware.</p>

                    <br> 

                    <p> The physics plugin and robot simulation will be completed using Unreal Engine. The engine will not only allow for an accurate, physics-based simulation, but also an aesthetic one. </p>

                    <p class="lead">TiM $10K Challenge Competition Entry as well as my academic research project.</p>
                    <p class="lead">2019 - 2020: Completed</p>
                    <hr class="my-4">
                    <p>The TiM $10K Challenge is an annual competition hosted by SICK. Inc, a German company that manufactures sensors for factory and logistics automation. The goal of the competition is rather vague and open-ended: Simply use the TiM781, a 2D LIDAR sensor, in any application. For this competition, I teamed up with my friend (who is a Mechanical Engineer), and we came up with the idea for Project Sentinel: an autonomous robot that is designed to become a part of a security team and detect intruders in an indoor environment. The robot houses a novel mechanism that rotates the 2D sensor in 3-dimensions and is able to accurately reproduce 3D environments. Once the environment is scanned, the plan was to feed the data into a Kalman Filter to track detected objects in the environment. The robot would use a SLAM algorithm to map the environment. Unfortunately, the complexity of the algorithm and the time constraint of being a full-time student in college led to the algorithms never being finished. Even though we did not place in the competition, we were extremely proud of the progress we made. </p>

                    <br> 

                    <p> The robot's mechanism was designed by my partner. There was an inexpensive MPU-6050 accelerometer, which was used to correctly orient the LIDAR data in 3D space. The robot's ambulation was controlled by 2 motors and the robot mechanism was controlled by its own motor. These were all programmed using an Arduino UNO and a PID algorithm was tuned to rotate the mechanism in a smooth manner. The accelerometer was not plugged into the Arduino for the simple reason that the rest of the robot maxed out the number of available interrupt pins. The LIDAR sensor was connected to a Raspberry Pi 3, since the primary communication port was Ethernet. Additionally, the Raspberry Pi has WiFi capabilities built in, so it would be easy to upload the data.</p>

                    <br> 

                    <p> The controller code for the sensor was written in Python 3. Once the data was captured, it was uploaded to AWS DynamoDB. A separate script converted the raw data to the .las format, which allows it to be interpreted by LIDAR software. From here, it was uploaded to an S3 bucket. I coded an Electron app that could view the scans on S3, complete with measurement tools and the ability to search through scans. Since this was coded on Electron, the app was cross-platform, being able to be viewed on Windows, Mac OS, and Linux. </p>

                    <p>I took ECE 408 in my spring semester junior year. The final project for the course was to take multithreaded, sequential raytracing code and drastically speed it up by using CUDA on GPUs. The actual background for the raytracing algorithm is a bit involved, but it involves approximating the rendering equation. The algorithm is a bit simplified so that it was able to be completed in a few weeks, but this meant that it only works with spheres.</p>

                    <p> The final code was tested on the school's GPU cluster (TITAN V GPUs) as well as my personal GPU (Nvidia 2060 Super), and we were able to achieve an incredible speedup.</p>

                    <p class="lead">Award-winning noninvasive EEG headset proof of concept</p>
                    <p class="lead">February 2019 - Status: Completed</p>
                    <hr class="my-4">
                    <p>Every year, UIUC holds a competition called a Hackathon. The hackathon is a 36-hour competition where the competitors are asked to design (usually code) anything. At the end of the 36 hours, the results are judged based on merit and usefulness of the submissions. One of my friends has always had an interest in the concept of Electroencephalography (EEG waves). While usually used for diagnosing brain disorders (such as epilepsy and seizure-related disorders), there is actually much more information that can be gleaned from these EEG waves - and this premise is where Project HackMe was born. Everyone's brain generates miniscule electrical impulses (miniscule here meaning ~50 microvolts). By finding the frequency of these waves and then doing some signal processing, we can characterize a person's state. One of the key features of our project to show we could do all of this non-invasively and still gather useful information from the data gathered. Then, we can map a person's waves to thoughts by using advanced machine learning techniques. </p>
                    <br> 
                    <p> The idea is novel, but is a bit ambitious for a 36 hour competition. Instead, we set out to do a proof of concept where we would show that waves could be captured and then translated to a rough thought. My friend had already purchased some electrodes. We then took these electrodes and fed them directly into a 24-bit ADC (During the competition, there was no additional filtering done to the signal. Given more time, we would have designed a low pass filter circuit to properly filter the input signal). The ADC was a part of a Raspberry Pi 3 shield, which allowed us to easily access the data using simple Python scripts. Since the Raspberry Pi has WiFi built-in, it was simple to upload this data to an Azure database (we used Azure because it was free, however, it was not worth it. We lost countless hours trying to set it up on the Raspberry Pi). </p>
                    <br> 
                    <p> Once the data was on the server, the project split into a few different areas: Internet of Things (IoT) and Classification. These sections are discussed in more detail below.</p>
                    <br> 
                    <p> IoT: As a commercial product, we imagined this being a beanie. The concept was that the beanie could house a custom PCB to perform the wave extraction and signal processing. It would then send the results to the cloud for further post processing and analysis. The idea of a beanie came up because people wear beanies for extended periods of time and we would be able to extract much more data and thus make meaningful observations on the resulting data. To demonstrate an IoT application, we showed that we could toggle the lights in a room just by thinking. This was shown by hooking an LED up to a Particle IoT board and toggling it based on the output from the EEG headset. We ended up with a very sophisticated mood ring.</p>
                    <br> 
                    <p> Classification: Analyzing the frequency content of the waves can indicate the general feeling of the user. Some of the most common EEG waves:</p>
                    <ul>
                    <li class="hackme-list"> Delta (3 Hz): Most commonly found in deep cycles of sleep.</li>
                    <li class="hackme-list"> Theta (3.5 to 7 Hz): Most commonly found in children. Implies an abnormality in the person if they are an adult. </li>
                    <li class="hackme-list"> Alpha (7.5 to 13 Hz): Most commonly found in people who are relaxing and is eradicated by any deep concentration. </li>
                    <li class="hackme-list"> Beta: (14 - 38 Hz): Most commonly found in people who are thinking a lot of thoughts at once. </li>
                    <li class="hackme-list">Gamma: (38 - 42 Hz): Greater than the frequency of neuronal firing, gamma waves relate to processing of different brain areas at once. </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p> The data was sent into a rudimentary Matlab linear classifier. Given more time, this would probably be implemented with a CNN that would be trained per individual user.</p>
                    <br> 
                    <p> This project was very well received at the 2019 Hackathon. It won the Caterpillar and Particle Design Awards, and was also a runner-up for the Hackathon. More information can be found <a href="https://devpost.com/software/hackme"><u>here</u></a>.</p>

                    <p>I was an active member of Illini Formula Electric (IFE), where we design and build a formula-style electric car from scratch. The club is entirely student run. We are limited to 300V. In the summer we compete at the FSAE competition in several events. The battery that our car runs off of is comprised of 336 LiFePO4 cells that are wired together in a series-parallel combination that yields 300V and 175A overall. The competition rules require us to monitor the temperature and voltage of each battery cell. The old method of doing this was using the Elithion Proprietary Battery Management System (BMS). This system only runs on very old team laptops, which are archaic, cumbersome, and limited to a hardwire connection. As a freshman, I designed a PCB that could read data off the CAN bus and then output it over bluetooth to a laptop.</p>
                    <br> 
                    <p> In addition, I also developed a GUI that was capable of outputting the data in realtime. This was done in C# using the .NET framework.</p>

                    <p class="lead">Senior Tech Final Project</p>
                    <p class="lead">August 2016 - Status: Completed</p>
                    <hr class="my-4">
                    <p>S.T.E.V.E. (which stands for Self Teaching Elevated Vehicle Entity), is a drone designed from scratch that was designed to serve as an aid during natural disasters. S.T.E.V.E. was designed for Senior Tech, which was a high school capstone course where we could work on any STEM related project for a year. The concept was to create an autonomous drone capable of surveying locations where individuals stranded in dangerous situations could be without risking the life of an emergency responder. To accomplish this, we made a fully featured drone with a custom flight controller, camera to view the surroundings (to live stream what the environment looks like back to a VR headset at the base station), a speaker with an onboard AI (to communicate to a victim of a natural disaster), and sensors (to make sure it doesn't fly into any obstacles as well as update location). Even though we were extremely ambitious and did not meet all of our goals, this project was ultimately a success. The project was met with high praise and was presented at a limited engineering expo at Navistar. This is also the project that made me realize I wanted to be a Computer Engineer, as this project was worked on during the time in which I applied to colleges. Working on this project made me realize my love for combining hardware and software to produce something greater than the sum of its parts. </p>
                    <br> 
                    <p> Flight Controller - A crucial part of any drone is the flight controller. The flight controller is responsible for controlling the speed of each motor to Most drone projects will use an inexpensive off-the-shelf flight controller that takes care of all the flight algorithms. All you have to do is plug in the motors and battery to have a functional drone. However, we thought it would be better as a learning experience if we designed and programmed the flight controller from scratch. We used an Arduino UNO as our primary microcontroller and an inexpensive MPU-6050 as our Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU). We then progreammed a PID controller to realize our flight controller. This took a bulk of our school year (and grew into a thousand line plus program) but was an incredibly rewarding experience. The microcontroller was programmed in C/C++ using the Arduino IDE.</p>
                    <br> 
                    <p> Camera/Virtual Reality Headset - The goal here was to come up with a way to stream camera footage from the drone back to a virtual reality headset. This could be used to allow emergency responders to remotely survey a disaster area without the need to send in personnel. From an engineering standpoint, it is an interesting feature to try to implement. We used a Raspberry Pi 3 as the computer and Raspberry Pi Camera for the camera. There were two reasons we went with this combination: (1) Raspberry Pis (and their cameras) are cheap, easy-to-use and well documented, and (2) This allowed to split the hardware for the project into two categories: flight essential and not flight essential. One of the most important factors optimized in a flight controller is how long the main loop of the code takes. The faster (typically) the better. By separating the hardware into what was essential for flight and what wasn't, we could could aggressively optimize the flight controller and still have other devices on the drone. If we tried to get the Arduino to compute and transfer the camera footage, the flight loop might get severely impacted and the drone would no longer fly smoothly.</p>
                    <br> 
                    <p> Speaker/AI - This is also not flight essential hardware and was supported by the Raspberry Pi (this was made simple by the fact that there is an audio out jack on the Pi). The main goal here was to give STEVE a natural language artificial intelligence so that STEVE could talk to people and let them know help is on the way. The initial thought was to use simple if-else constructs and hard-code the speaker outputs (i.e. "Help is on the way"), but then we had the idea of using IBM AI APIs to get a natural language output from the Raspberry Pi. After struggling for a few weeks with the IBM documentation, we contacted them and they sent us a sample Android app that used their APIs. After this, it was easy to link this with the Raspberry Pi and output it through the speaker. We trained the AI and attempted to make the outputs as helpful as possible in the relevant situation. </p>
                    <br> 
                    <p> Object detection and location updates - One fundamental aspect of a drone is to not fly into nearby objects. Real drones use laser-detection to detect nearby objects, but those sensors are expensive and difficult to get working so we chose to use inexpensive ultrasonic sensors. Our end goal was to have 6 sensors in each axis, 3 in each direction (for instance, we would have 3 pointing directly upwards and 3 pointing directly downwards, thus covering the z-axis). We used a MUX shield, which adds 37 additional inputs to the Arduino and we ended up writing our own custom drivers to capture the ultrasonic values (it turns out provided library functions start to fail when you try to use an external shield). The driver code worked perfectly fine, but due to time constraints we were not able to interface it with the rest of the drone. We were able to add an off-the-shelf GPS module, which was capable of logging the drone's coordinates. Combined with the ultrasonic sensors, we were able to show that we could capture coordinates in 3-dimensions. </p>
                    <br>
                    <p> Even though we were not able to meet all of the goals we set for the project, we consider STEVE an incredible success. </p>
