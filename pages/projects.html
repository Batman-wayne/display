                <p class="lead">Senior Tech Final Project - Completed</p>
                <hr class="my-4">

                <p>S.T.E.V.E. (which stands for Self Teaching Elevated Vehicle Entity), is a drone designed from scratch that was designed to serve as an aid during natural disasters. This was designed for Senior Tech, which was a capstone course where we could work on any STEM related project for a year. The idea was to create an autonomous drone capable of surveying locations where individuals stranded in dangerous situations could be without risking the life of an emergency responder. To accomplish this, we made a fully featured drone with a custom flight controller, camera to view the surroundings (to live stream what the environment looks like back to a VR headset at the base station), a speaker with an onboard AI (to communicate to a victim of a natural disaster), and sensors (to make sure it doesn't fly into any obstacles as well as update location). Even though we were extremely ambitious and did not meet all of our goals, this project was ultimately a success. The project was met with high praise and was invited to present at an engineering expo at Navistar. This is also the project that made me realize I wanted to be a Computer Engineer. </p>

                <br> 

                <p> Flight Controller - A crucial part of any drone is the flight controller. Most drone projects will buy an inexpensive off-the-shelf flight controller that takes care of all the flight algorithms. All you have to do is plug in the motors and battery to have a functional drone. However, we thought it would be better as a learning experience if we designed and programmed the flight controller from scratch. We used an Arduino UNO as our primary microcontroller and an inexpensive MPU-6050 as our Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU). We then a PID controller to realize our flight controller. This took a bulk of our school year (and grew into a thousand line plus program) but was an incredibly rewarding experience. </p>

                <br> 

                <p> Camera/Virtual Reality Headset - We used a Raspberry Pi 3 and Raspberry Pi Camera for the camera. There were two reasons we went with this combination: (1) Raspberry Pis (and their cameras) are cheap, easy-to-use and well documented, and (2) This allowed to split the hardware for the project into two categories: flight-essential and non-flight essential. This way, we could minimize the time that a feedback loop takes to calculate and not lose the capability of smooth flight. Asking the Arduino to do the camera data transmission might be taxing on the microcontroller.</p>

                <br> 

                <p> Speaker/AI - This is also non-flight essential hardware and was supported by the Raspberry Pi (this was made simple by the fact that there is an audio out jack on the Pi). The initial thought was to use simple if-else constructs and hard-code the speaker outputs (i.e. "Help is on the way"), but then we had the idea of using IBM AI APIs to get a natural language output from the Raspberry Pi. After struggling for a few weeks with the IBM documentation, we contacted them and they sent us a sample Android app that used their APIs. After this, it was easy to link this with the Raspberry Pi and output it through the speaker. We trained the AI and attempted to make the outputs as helpful as possible in the relevant situation. </p>

                <br> 

                <p> Object detection and location updates - One fundamental aspect of a drone is to not fly into nearby objects. Real drones use laser-detection to detect nearby objects, but those sensors are expensive and difficult to get working so we chose to use ultrasonic sensors. Our end goal was to have 6 sensors in each axis, 3 in each direction (for instance, we would have 3 pointing directly upwards and 3 pointing directly downwards, thus covering the z-axis). We used a MUX shield, which adds 37 additional inputs to the Arduino and we ended up writing our own custom drivers to capture the ultrasonic values (it turns out provided library functions start to fail when you try to use an external shield). The driver code worked perfectly fine, but due to time constraints we were not able to interface it with the rest of the drone. We were able to add an off-the-shelf GPS module, which was capable of logging the drone's coordinates. Combined with the ultrasonic sensors, we were able to show that we could capture coordinates in 3-dimensions. </p>

                <p class="lead">Award-winning noninvasive EEG headset proof of concept</p>
                <hr class="my-4">

                <p>Every year, UIUC holds a competition called a Hackathon. The hackathon is a 36-hour competition where the competitors are asked to design (usually code) anything. At the end of the 36 hours, the results are judged based on merit and usefulness of the submissions. One of my friends has always had an interest in the concept of Electroencephalography (EEG waves). While usually used for diagnosing brain disorders (such as epilepsy and seizure-related disorders), there is actually much more information that can be gleaned from these EEG waves - and this premise is where Project HackMe was born. In general, everyone's brain generates miniscule electrical impulses (on the order of 50 microvolts). By finding the frequency of these waves (and then doing some signal processing), we can characterize a person's state. One of the key features of our project was the concept of non-invasive electrodes. We set out to prove that without using invasive electrodes, we could still gather useful information from the data gathered. The idea is to then map a person's waves to thoughts by using advanced machine learning techniques. </p>

                <br> 

                <p> The idea is novel, but is a bit ambitious for a 36 hour competition. Instead, we set out to do a proof of concept where we would show that waves could be captured and then translated to a rough thought. My friend had already purchased some electrodes - we then took these electrodes and fed them directly into a 24-bit ADC (given more time, we would have designed a low pass filter circuit to properly filter the input signal). The ADC was a part of a Raspberry Pi 3 shield, which allowed us to easily access the data using Python. Since the Raspberry Pi has WiFi built-in, it was simple to upload this data to an Azure database (we used Azure because it was free, however, it was not worth it. We lost countless hours trying to set it up on the Raspberry Pi). </p>

                <br> 

                <p> Once the data was on the server, the project split into a few different areas: Internet of Things (IoT), Classification, and Validation. </p>

                <br> 

                <p> IoT: As a commercial product, we imagined this being a beanie. The concept was that the beanie could house a custom PCB to perform the wave extraction and signal processing. It would then send the results to the cloud for further post processing and analysis. The idea of a beanie came up because people wear beanies for extended periods of time and we would be able to extract much more data and thus make meaningful observations on the resulting data. </p>
